##Step o library and dependency
```{r}
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("SnowballC")
library(tm)
```

##Step 1 Load Data
```{r}
df <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/User/Documents/UNITS/Magistrale/Primo Anno/1Â°semestre/Machine Learning/SvevoLetters/carteggiosvevo3.csv", sep = ";", header = TRUE)
head(df)
```
##Step 2 pre processing
```{r}
LetterCorpussection <- table(df[,2])
Sections <- dim(LetterCorpussection)
Sections
```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
